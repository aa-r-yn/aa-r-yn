# Hi, I'm Aryan 👋

I'm a Bachelor of Artificial Intelligence student at UTS, interested in Applied AI, Computer Vision, and Robotics.

##🚁 Featured Project
AutoLZ (Autonomous Landing Zone) — a team project where we trained a YOLOv5 model from scratch to detect a landing pad and help a programmable drone land autonomously in controlled environments.

##🧰 Tech I use
- Python
- PyTorch, OpenCV
- Computer Vision, Object Detection (YOLO)
- Model training, dataset collection & augmentation

##🎯 Currently focused on
- Building a strong AI portfolio on GitHub
- Practical ML/DL projects with clear documentation & results
